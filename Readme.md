# Want to see the Oscar race? Check out this project

![Oscar](data/oscars.png)

Since we are in the Oscar season, to make the wait more enjoyable I have created this project to analyze the Oscar race. I have compiled, filtered, cleaned and graphed information about the awards, from 1990 to 2020, that I consider most relevant to this race; Golden Globes, SAG (Screen Actor Guild Awards), Critics' Choice Movie Awards and of course the Oscars. In order to see the correlation of the awards and in the future, be able to make a predictive analysis of the winners, and keep it updated!
