Since we are in the Oscar season, to make the wait more enjoyable I have created this project to analyze the Oscar race. I have compiled, filtered, cleaned and graphed information about the awards, from 1990 to 2020, that I consider most relevant to this race; Golden Globes, SAG (Screen Actor Guild Awards), Critics' Choice Movie Awards and of course the Oscars. In order to see the correlation of the awards and in the future, be able to make a predictive analysis of the winners, and keep it updated!

## Usage

Folder scheme: Inside Oscar_Race you can find a data folder, which contains all the csv files of this project. The ones I have used for the cleanup taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/);
- [the_oscar_award](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award)
- [golden_globe_awards](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/golden-globe-awards)
- [screen_actor_guild_awards](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/screen-actors-guild-awards)

The ones I've created from these, with their respective cleaning and standardization;
- [Oscar_clean](data/Oscar_clean.csv)
- [Golden_Globes_clean](data/Golden_Globes_clean.csv)
- [SAG_clean](data/AG_clean.csv)

And also the ones IÂ´ve created from [wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics%27_Choice_Movie_Awards#Categories) web scraping and their respective cleaning and standardization;
- [Best_Picture_soup_cca](data/Best_Picture_soup_cca.csv)
- [Actor_In_A_Leading_Role_soup_cca](data/Actor_In_A_Leading_Role_soup_cca.csv)
- [Actor_In_A_Supporting_Role_soup_cca](data/Actor_In_A_Supporting_Role_soup_cca.csv)

- [Actress_In_A_Supporting_Role_soup_cca](data/Actress_In_A_Supporting_Role_soup_cca.csv)
- [CCA_clean](data/CCA_clean.csv)

And finally all awards gathered in a single csv:

In the notebooks folder you can find the code I've used for each of the cleaning, web scraping, storage and visualization tasks.

In the src folder there is a .py document called [support](src/support.py) where all the functions that I have created for this project are collected.
